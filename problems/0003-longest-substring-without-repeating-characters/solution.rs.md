# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters — Rust syntax

Notes on the syntax in [`solution.rs`](solution.rs). New features are explained in
the [Rust handbook](../../languages/rust.md); already-known ones are linked there.

## New here
- `text: String` — [`String` type](../../languages/rust.md#string): the function
  *owns* the text it's handed, rather than borrowing a view of it. We only read it, so
  the distinction never bites us here. (The LeetCode default name is `s`; we rename it
  to `text` to match the repo's descriptive-naming style.)
- `text.chars()` — [`.chars()`](../../languages/rust.md#chars): walks the string one
  *character* at a time (not one byte), which is what lets us count substring length
  in characters.
- `for (current_index, current_char) in text.chars().enumerate()` — same
  [`.enumerate()`](../../languages/rust.md#for-iter-enumerate) as Two Sum, but note
  the pattern is a plain `current_char` with **no `&`**: `.chars()` yields owned
  `char` values, so there's no reference to peel (contrast the `&current_value` we
  needed when `.iter()` gave us `&i32`).
- `window_start` / `current_index` are `usize` —
  [`usize` and underflow](../../languages/rust.md#usize): the subtraction
  `current_index - window_start + 1` is only safe because `window_start` can never
  pass `current_index`; a `usize` going negative would panic.
- `longest.max(...)` — [`.max()`](../../languages/rust.md#ord-max): keeps the running
  maximum window width without an explicit `if`.

## Already covered
- `use std::collections::HashMap;` — [`use`](../../languages/rust.md#use)
- `impl Solution { ... }` — [`impl` block](../../languages/rust.md#impl)
- `pub fn length_of_longest_substring(...) -> i32` — [`pub fn`](../../languages/rust.md#pub-fn)
- `HashMap<char, usize>` / `HashMap::new()` / `.get()` / `.insert()` —
  [`HashMap`](../../languages/rust.md#hashmap), Rust's spelling of the
  [hash map](../../glossary/hash-map.md) concept
- `let mut last_seen_index` / `let mut window_start` / `let mut longest` —
  [`let mut`](../../languages/rust.md#let-mut): all three are reassigned as we scan
- `if let Some(&previous_index) = ...` — [`if let` with `Option`](../../languages/rust.md#if-let),
  and the `&previous_index` is the same [`&`-in-patterns](../../languages/rust.md#ref-pattern)
  peel that lifts the `usize` out of the `&usize` that `.get()` returns
- `longest as i32` — [`as` cast](../../languages/rust.md#as-cast): the running maximum
  is a `usize`; LeetCode wants an `i32` back

## Line by line
The interesting parts are the window bookkeeping; the rest mirrors Two Sum.

**The map.**
```rust
let mut last_seen_index: HashMap<char, usize> = HashMap::new();
```
The **key** is a character and the value is the **last index we saw it at**. So an
entry `'b' → 1` reads as "the most recent `b` was at position 1." It's `mut` because
we overwrite a character's position every time we meet it again.

**The two counters.**
```rust
let mut window_start = 0;
let mut longest = 0;
```
`window_start` is the left edge of the current repeat-free window; `longest` is the
widest window we've measured so far. Both are `usize` (inferred from the arithmetic
below), and both change as we scan, so both are `mut`.

**The loop header.**
```rust
for (current_index, current_char) in text.chars().enumerate() {
```
`.chars()` hands us each character *by value* as a `char`, and `.enumerate()` pairs
it with its position, giving `(usize, char)` each turn. Because the character comes
by value, the pattern is a plain `current_char` — there's no `&` to peel, unlike the
`.iter()` loop in Two Sum where each item was a *reference*.

**Slide the left edge.**
```rust
    if let Some(&previous_index) = last_seen_index.get(&current_char) {
        if previous_index >= window_start {
            window_start = previous_index + 1;
        }
    }
```
`.get(&current_char)` asks the map "have I seen this character, and where?" and
returns an [`Option`](../../languages/rust.md#if-let) — `Some` on a hit, `None`
otherwise. The `&previous_index` peels the `&usize` down to a plain `usize`. The
**inner** `if` is the crux of the whole algorithm: we move the left edge *only* when
the previous sighting is at or after `window_start` — i.e. still inside the current
window. If it's before `window_start`, that old copy was already dropped and isn't a
real repeat, so we leave the edge alone. Moving it there would drag the edge
*backward*, which on `usize` positions would also risk the underflow panic described
in the handbook.

**Record and measure.**
```rust
    last_seen_index.insert(current_char, current_index);
    longest = longest.max(current_index - window_start + 1);
```
First stamp this character's new latest position into the map (overwriting any older
one). Then `current_index - window_start + 1` is the current window's width — the
count of characters from the left edge through here — and `.max` keeps it only if
it beats the best so far. This runs *after* the edge may have moved, so the width is
always measured on a clean, repeat-free window.

**The return.**
```rust
longest as i32
```
`longest` is a `usize`; the judge wants an `i32`, so we [cast](../../languages/rust.md#as-cast)
it. As the last expression with no semicolon, it *is* the return value.
